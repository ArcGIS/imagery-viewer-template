# Description
Imagery Viewer is a configurable app template for visualizing and exploring imagery through time and space, and includes tools for navigating through time, recording locations, measurement, and more. A one-image configuration lets users focus on a single imagery layer, while a two-image configuration lets users compare two imagery layers using a swipe tool. 
Imagery Viewer users can do the following:
·	Visualize imagery layers (and non-imagery layers) from the app’s web map
·	Explore an imagery layer through time for an area of interest
·	Zoom to bookmarked areas of interest (or bookmark their own)
·	Select specific images from a layer to visualize 
·	Annotate imagery using editable feature layers
·	Perform image measurement on imagery layers that have mensuration capabilities
·	Export an imagery layer to the user's local machine, or as a layer in the user’s ArcGIS account
Plus, with the two-image option users can also compare two imagery layers (or single images) using a swipe tool, making it easier to compare imagery using different renderers, from different dates, or from different image services.
Possible use cases include:
·	A student investigating urban expansion over time
·	A farmer using NAIP imagery to visualize his land and record crop types
·	An image analyst recording the location of an aircraft identified from high resolution satellite imagery
·	A property appraiser recording notes about newly constructed houses, including calculating building heights in-app
